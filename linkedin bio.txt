I am a highly motivated individual seeking a challenging position in a reputed organization where I can continue to increase my knowledge and skills while contributing to the growth of the organization and society. Currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Applications from IGNOU The People's University, I have also completed my Bachelor's degree in Science from BJB Autonomous College.
I possess a range of technical skills, including Java, software engineering, HTML, SQL, C++, Unix, CSS, PHP, and data structures. Additionally, I hold certificates in web development from NIIT Foundation sponsored by Microsoft and core Java from LTLT EDUTECH PVT. LTD.

I have achieved several accolades, such as securing the first position in Odia debate at Gondia High School, ranking third in 600mts race at KIIT Higher Secondary School, and clinching the first position in Block level Science Exhibition at Gondia Block, Dhenkanal.
My strengths include being flexible in my work habits, taking initiative in a group setting, and having a strong urge to involve myself completely and learn fast. I am proficient in English, Odia, and Hindi.

Apart from academics, I enjoy reading books and novels, teaching classes, cooking, and volunteering in events. I believe these interests have helped me develop strong interpersonal and communication skills.

I look forward to contributing my expertise and learning from my colleagues in my future endeavorsI
